                    Speech: Disruptive Developments in the Court Room
                    (The lecture will inform the audience on the recent developments in intelligent legal-based systems.)
                    Abstract: Courts aim to judge almost perfectly,thereby relying on the best support available. Currently I see to possible futures. Future 1:Judges need the most advanced systems (computers and intelligent programs) for a proper assessment of cases (Comfort Zone) Future 2: A totally different and disruptive approach. A series of ‘capable systems’ replace traditional judges by autonomously executing their work. Lawyers and judges prefer to be supported by advanced computer programs so that they can handle as perfect judges. I will discuss the core values as required to be present at judges as well as other core values to be present at lawyers. The key question is whether intelligent systems can mimic these features and achieve the same level of values.
                    The two most challenging obstacles  of research in this respect are
                    (1) prediction of the verdict by the judges when taken into account the culture and the legacy, and
                    (1) e-discovery for confidential information as compared to privileged information ( for lawyers)
                    Finally, a timeline of expected occurrences will be given.

                    Speech: Disruptive Developments in the Court Room
                    (The lecture will inform the audience on the recent developments in intelligent legal-based systems.)
                    Abstract: Courts aim to judge almost perfectly,thereby relying on the best support available. Currently I see to possible futures. Future 1:Judges need the most advanced systems (computers and intelligent programs) for a proper assessment of cases (Comfort Zone) Future 2: A totally different and disruptive approach. A series of ‘capable systems’ replace traditional judges by autonomously executing their work. Lawyers and judges prefer to be supported by advanced computer programs so that they can handle as perfect judges. I will discuss the core values as required to be present at judges as well as other core values to be present at lawyers. The key question is whether intelligent systems can mimic these features and achieve the same level of values.
                    The two most challenging obstacles  of research in this respect are
                    (1) prediction of the verdict by the judges when taken into account the culture and the legacy, and
                    (1) e-discovery for confidential information as compared to privileged information ( for lawyers)
                    Finally, a timeline of expected occurrences will be given.

                    Biography: Jaap van den Herik studied mathematics (with honours) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and received his PhD degree at Delft University of Technology in 1983. In 1984 he was visiting professor at the McGill School of Computer Science in Montreal. Thereafter, he was subsequently affiliated with Maastricht University (1987-2008), Tilburg University (2008-2016) as a full professor of Computer Science and with Leiden University as part time professor of Computer Science and Law (since 1988).

                    At Leiden University, Van den Herik was affiliated with the department of Computer Science (now LIACS) between 1984 and 1988. He became professor of Computer Science and Law in 1988, at the Center for Law in the Information Society (eLaw). Furthermore, he was Professor at the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) from 2014 to 2019. In 2014 he founded the Leiden Centre of Data Science (LCDS) together with Joost Kok and Jacqueline Meulman. From January 2019 he continues his work at the Mathematical Institute of the Leiden University.

                    Van den Herik’s research interests include artificial intelligence, intelligent legal systems, big data and social innovation. In 2012, he received an ERC Advanced Grant together with Jos Vermaseren (PI, Nikhef) and Aske Plaat, for the research proposal “Solving High Energy Physics Equations using Monte Carlo Gaming Techniques.” Van den Herik received a Humies Award in 2014, for his work on chess programming together with Omid E. David, Moshe Koppel, and Nathan S. Netanyahu.
